\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}

There are a number of interesting conclusions that can be drawn from the 
results printed in this paper. Based on our results, hardware transactional 
memory is unlikely to provide any significent performance improvement over 
traditional software based concurrency schemes in most situations.

Additionally, we did not feel that at this time it provides a large engineering 
benefit in making the code simpler or easier to get correct. This results from the 
fact that hardware transaction memory is still in development and not fully 
documented, whereas there exist many tools for implementing the traditional 
software based methods.

However, we see the potential of hardware transactional memory and conclude 
that it is a perfectly viable option for implementing concurrency control in 
a key-value store, including support for multi-key transactions and dynamic 
read/write sets.
